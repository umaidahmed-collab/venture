+TASK: Implement a basic UI application for login and registeration of user
+DESCRIPTION: Make a python UI and Basic Auth
+
+CURRENT STEP: Implement core functionality
+
+You are implementing a Authentication system.
+
+SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
+
+            - Implement JWT token-based authentication
+            - Create user registration and login endpoints
+            - Add password hashing and validation
+            - Include token refresh functionality
+            - Add proper security middleware
+            
+
+GENERAL GUIDELINES:
+1. Write clean, maintainable, production-ready code
+2. Follow existing code patterns and conventions in the repository
+3. Add comprehensive error handling and input validation
+4. Include detailed docstrings and comments
+5. Use type hints throughout the code
+6. Create functional, working implementations (not placeholders)
+7. Add unit tests if this step involves testing
+8. Update documentation if this step involves documentation
+
+IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS:
+- Create actual working code files that implement the requirements
+- Ensure all functions and classes are fully implemented
+- Add proper imports and dependencies
+- Make sure the code can be executed and tested
+- Follow the specific requirements for Authentication system
+- Replace any placeholder content with functional code
+- Create new files if needed to implement the functionality
+
+IMPORTANT: You MUST create or modify files to implement the functionality. Do not just analyze - actually write the code!
+
+Please implement this step completely and functionally. Create or modify the necessary files to fulfill this requirement.
