## FAST API with JWT Auth System
This project now includes a FAST API with a complete JWT Auth System. This allows for secure authentication and authorization in your application. To use this feature, follow the steps below:

1. Start the FAST API server.
2. Send a POST request to the `/token` endpoint with your username and password to receive a JWT token.
3. Include the JWT token in the Authorization header of your subsequent requests.

Please refer to the FAST API and JWT documentation for more details.
