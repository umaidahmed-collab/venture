# LAB-63: We need to implement a user profile management system that allows users to view and update their personal information.

h2. Requirements:

* Users should be able to view their current profile information
* Users should be able to update their name, email, and bio
* Profile updates should be validated before saving
* The system should show success/error messages appropriately

h2. Technical Details:

* Create a new API endpoint for profile management
* Add proper input validation
* Include error handling for database operations
* Follow existing code patterns in the project

h2. Acceptance Criteria:

* [ ] GET /api/profile endpoint returns current user profile
* [ ] PUT /api/profile endpoint allows profile updates
* [ ] Input validation prevents invalid data
* [ ] Appropriate HTTP status codes are returned
* [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
* [ ] Unit tests cover the new functionality

## Implementation Details

### Pattern: Api
The system detected this task as a **api** implementation and generated appropriate code.

## Usage Examples

See the individual source files for detailed usage examples and API documentation.

## Testing

The generated tests include:
- Unit tests for all major functions
- Edge case testing
- Error condition validation
- Performance considerations (where applicable)

Run tests to verify everything works correctly:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v --tb=short
```

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Review the generated code
2. ✅ Run the tests to ensure everything works
3. ✅ Customize the implementation as needed
4. ✅ Add additional features or improvements
5. ✅ Deploy or integrate with your system
